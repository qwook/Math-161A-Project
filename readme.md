# MATH 161A Project

* Uniform Distribution - min = 0, max = 100
* Weibull Distribution - shape(alpha) = 2, scale(beta) = 10
* Beta Distribution - alpha = 2, beta = 3
* LogNormal Distribution - mean = 0, std deviation = 1

# Generating PDF files
I've already included the PDF files I've generated in this repo, but if you want to play around with the code and generate your own, you're free to.

You will need this:
http://www.r-project.org/

It is a command-line interface, so you will need to run it in the terminal.
To execute, run `Rscript project.r`
